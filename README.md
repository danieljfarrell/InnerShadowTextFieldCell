Usage
-----

1. Drag a label on to you NSView.
2. Set the font, text colour and background colour to appropriate values.
3. Change the 'custom class' of the NSTextField from NSTextFieldCell to InnerShadowTextFieldCell.

Note that the drawing method of the class comes with some default values so you don't need to provide a NSShadow type. The default is to draw a light grey shadow as in the image above. If you want more customisation then you can supply a NSShadow by using the -innerShadow property.
